  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Rather than relying on explicit programming, machine learning systems use data to recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including supervised learning (where models are trained on labeled data), unsupervised learning (which finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (which enables agents to learn through interaction with an environment). Machine learning has applications in various domains, from image and speech recognition to recommendation systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, revolutionizing industries by leveraging the power of data-driven insights and automation.
